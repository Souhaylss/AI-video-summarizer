* **The Internet vs. the World Wide Web:**
    * The Internet is a network connecting computers for information sharing.  Early forms involved direct computer-to-computer calls; now, seamless communication is the norm.  Uses include email, file transfer, conferencing, and accessing the World Wide Web.
    * The World Wide Web is a system built *on top* of the Internet. It's a collection of web servers (computers storing and sharing information) accessed via websites.  Think of it as a virtual city with skyscrapers representing servers.

* **Website Structure and Access:**
    * Websites are hosted on web servers.  Web hosting companies rent server space.  Anyone with the right equipment and knowledge can set up a web server.
    * Website addresses (domain names) are essential for locating specific websites, similar to real-world addresses.
    * Web pages are created using web languages like HTML and JavaScript. Web browsers translate this code into user-friendly content (words, images, videos).

* **Ownership and Access:**
    * No single entity owns the World Wide Web. It's a public resource.
    * Users need internet service providers (ISPs) for access, hosting companies for website space, and registrars to reserve domain names.  These are like utility companies, providing essential services but not owning the Web itself.

* **The Uniqueness of the Web:**
    * The Web’s structure is key to its success.  Unlike linear information consumption (like books), the Web uses hyperlinks to connect information non-linearly, mirroring the way our brains work.
    * Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, designed it to reflect the interconnectedness of human thought.  Hyperlinks allow users to immediately follow related information on the same or different websites.

* **Societal Impact:**
    * The Web’s structure and content reflect both society and individual minds. It connects people across boundaries of ethnicity, gender, age, time, and space.
